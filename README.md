# newsourcepredictor
In this Project, we present an approach and a model for predicting the source of a news article by taking advantage of the perceived partisan  bias and sentiment of news sources . Our system developed the implemented model using a dataset we built by using a web scraping bot that crawled both CNN and The New York Posts. The dataset consists of a csv file contains over seven thousand news articles as well as their source--CNN or The New York posts. We created the news source prediction system by leveraging BERT sentence embeddings. After creating, training and using the models to make predictions, we achieved an F1 score of about 89%.
